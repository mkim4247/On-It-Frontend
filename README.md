# README
On It was created as a simple project and task management app. Users can create their own private boards to organize personal projects and/or join teams to work on group projects together. Users can create, edit, or delete Boards, which consist of Projects, which further consist of Tasks. They may also leave comments on Projects to ask questions, have discussions, or leave reminders/notes.

The frontend was developed on React 16.8.1 and Redux 4.0.1, and also utilizes React-DOM, React-Router-DOM, and Redux-Thunk. Semantic-UI-React was used extensively throughout the app as well.
